# Synthetic biology technobabble generator
This small script generates Markov chain random text (called Lorem Ipsum, dissociated press, technobabble etc.)

To generate random text simply run the python3 script thusly:

    $ python3 SynBio_press.py

See `example.txt` for a lorger exerpt.

The script can have the `abstract.txt` file, the `min` and the `max` words specified. For more, type

    $ python3 SynBio_press.py -h

## Training
The script relies an a Markov chain, _i.e._ the probability of a word being drawn is influenced by the preceeding word.

It is trained on synthetic biology abstracts in Pubmed. Which are saved as the file `abstracts.txt` but can be fetched via:

    >>> Press.fetch_abstracts('synthetic biology')

Which takes a few hours (no parallelisation). Then the Markov chain probabilities are generated:

    >>> Press.make_trainer()

Which, unless specified differently generates the file `abstract.json`, and returns a generator.

For options on each see the docstrings on the relevant methods.
